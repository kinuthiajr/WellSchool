C# OOP Library Management System

Folder and file structure: The classes are in the folder called **Models** *book.cs* file and the *Program.cs* is where the objects created from the classes are implemented.

## Assignment: Library Management System
Objective:
Design and implement a library management system using C# that demonstrates the use of classes, methods, access modifiers, and OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

## Scenario:
You are tasked with creating a basic library management system for a local library. The system should manage books, members, and the borrowing process.

# Requirements:
Classes and Objects:

Create classes for Library, Book, Member, and BorrowTransaction.

# Encapsulation:

Use private fields for data members and provide public methods for accessing and modifying them.

# Inheritance:

Create a base class Person with properties like Name and Email. Inherit Member class from Person.

# Polymorphism:

Create a method DisplayInfo() in Person class and override it in Member class to display member-specific information.

# Abstraction:

Create an abstract class LibraryItem with properties like Title and Author, and an abstract method GetInfo(). Derive the Book class from LibraryItem and implement the abstract method.

# Access Modifiers:

Use different access modifiers (public, private, protected, internal, protected internal) appropriately in your classes to control the access to members.


***Submission:***
 submit your  solution as a complete C# project.
The project should compile and run without errors.
The code should follow good programming practices, including proper naming conventions and code comments where necessary.

***Evaluation Criteria:***
Correctness: Does your  code compile and run correctly?
Use of OOP Principles: Are encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction correctly implemented?
Use of Access Modifiers: Are access modifiers correctly used to control access to class members?
Code Quality: Is the code well-organized and easy to understand
